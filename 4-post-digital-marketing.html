                <h1 class="post-page-title">What It Takes To Be Self-Employed</h1>
                <p class="post-text-e">
                    Why Digital word has become a synonym to be advanced and more connected to the customer because the world has become complex and much more connected than a decade ago. <br><br>
                    The more you connect with the people on a regular basis the more you grow has become the trend. I'm sure your inquisitive mind asking provide examples -<br><br>
                    Facebook's revenue grew from 7.87 billion in 2013 to 27.64 billion US dollars in 2016, Apple's revenue grew from 65.2 billion in 2010 to 215 billion US dollars in 2016.<br><br>
                    Isn't that phenomenal. <br><br>
                    What's the difference between the big conglomerates (not doing so well - Siemens, GE, Ford, GM, IBM, Oracle, Microsoft) and compare it with the Facebook's, Apple's, WhatsApp and other such companies which grew extraordinarily in last 5 years. <br><br>
                    The difference includes lot many factors and one of the biggest factor is - Being DIGITAL connects MAN and the MACHINES all around the World, and the result is higher revenue growth. <br><br>
                    A chat application WhatsApp fetches 20 Billion sell off. Because somebody in the world understands the value of Customer Base on Digital Platform. <br><br>
                    This is what we can achieve for your business be it small or medium or even the bigger ones. Its time to go global, become Digital, increase your reach, become a name in people's mind. <br><br>
                    CONNECT to your Customers digitally now or else your competitor will certainly grab that opportunity. <br><br>
                    Do you know how TRUMP or MODI won the elections? Digital Marketing and Media helped them become a household discussion. <br><br>
                    Its a need of the hour to have a solid Digital Marketing Solution built to promote the company and the products to become a household name and establish the connection with the People (Prospects). <br><br>
                    I hope all of us receive tele marketing calls to buy a personal loan. These are mostly blind calls because tele-marketers are just given the phone numbers of the people who earn well but that doesn't mean that they should buy your product. So blind tele-marketing conversion can never be more than 5%. <br><br>
                    If we bring Data Science Intelligence in our approach to reach out to the customers based on demographics, product interests, product groupings, age, sex, income range, culture, background. You might not waste your time selling wrong products to wrong customers. Just imagine how wise would it be if you are selling a villa to a peon or an ambassador to a CEO of the company. <br><br>
                    CONNECT with your CUSTOMER digitally well. And see the response. Digital Marketing is still catching up, be in front and TAKE the ADVANTAGE of latest Technologies and bring them into PLAY for Growth of your business.
